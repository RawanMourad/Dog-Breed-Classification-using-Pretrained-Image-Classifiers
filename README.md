## Dog Breed Classification using Pretrained Image Classifiers
This repository contains the code and files for the first project of the *AI Programming with Python* course, which is a part of the *AWS Scholarship for AI & ML* program. The project focuses on utilizing pretrained image classifiers to accurately classify different dog breeds. The project involved experimenting with various pretrained models such as VGG16, ResNet, and AlexNet.

## Project Overview

In this project, I explored the world of image classification using deep learning techniques. The main tasks of the project were as follows:

1. *Dataset Preparation:* I obtained a dataset of dog images, which was used for training and testing the models. The dataset consisted of various dog breeds.

2. *Data Preprocessing:* I performed necessary preprocessing steps on the dataset, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation. This prepared the data for training and validation.

3. *Model Selection:* I experimented with three popular pretrained image classifier models: VGG16, ResNet, and AlexNet. Each model was fine-tuned for our specific classification task.

4. *Model Training:* The selected models were trained on the preprocessed dataset. The training process involved adjusting hyperparameters and monitoring performance on validation data.

5. *Model Evaluation:* After training, I evaluated the models using a separate test dataset to measure their accuracy and performance.

6. *Results Comparison:* I compared the performance of the three models and analyzed their strengths and weaknesses in classifying different dog breeds.
