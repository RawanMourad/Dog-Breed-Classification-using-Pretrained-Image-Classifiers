Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three models were able to correctly predict the breed of Dog_01.jpg


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three models were able to predict the same breed in Dog_01.jpg as that in Dog_02.jpg


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: The VGG and Resnet architectures were able to classify Cat_01.jpg and Car_01.jpg as not dogs, however Alexnet wasn't able to correctly classify Cat_01.jpg as not dog and classified it as barbancon griffon


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I select the resnet as the best for classifying uploaded images. The resnet was able to correctly classify the four images better than Alexnet (which is our main objective), and the model classified the four images faster than VGG16, which gives a better performance overall over the other two architectures.
